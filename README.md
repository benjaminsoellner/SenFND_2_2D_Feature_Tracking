# Sensor Fusion Engineer Project 2 - 2D Feature Tracking

## Benjamin SÃ¶llner

This project is forked from the [Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313) online class content and subsequently completed to meet the courses project submission standards. The remaining section of this `README` includes the Reflection which has to be completed as part of this project and details about the general course content and how to build this project. The source code in this repo also contains the lesson quizzes in the separate ``src/quizzes`` folder. Go to [udacity/SFND_2D_Feature_Tracking](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_2D_Feature_Tracking) if you want to retrieve the original (unfinished) repo. Don't you cheat by copying my repo in order to use it as your Nanodegree submission! :-o

## Reflection

This section answers how this Udacity project submission fulfils the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2549/view).

### MP.1 Data Buffer Optimization

A ring buffer is implemented by processing the images in a ``std::deque`` which is kept of maximum size ``2`` by using ``push_back`` in addition to ``pop_front``.

### MP.2 Keypoint Detection

``HARRIS`` and ``SHITOMASI`` are implemented by own methods ``detKeypointsHarris`` using ``cv::xfeatures2d::HarrisLaplaceFeatureDetector`` and
``detKeypointsShiTomasi`` using ``cv::goodFeaturesToTrack`` respectively. ``FAST``, ``BRISK``, ``ORB``, ``AKAZE``, and ``SIFT`` are implemented in 
``detKeypointsModern``. All detectors are looped over in one main loop that executes all Detector / Descriptor combinations.

### MP.3 Keypoint Removal

All keypoints outside the rect ``cv::Rect vehicleRect(535, 180, 180, 150)`` are discarded by checking found keypoints against this rect with 
``vehicleRect.contains(keypoint.pt)``.

### MP.4 Keypoint Descriptors

``BRIEF``, ``ORB``, ``FREAK``, ``AKAZE`` and ``SIFT`` are implemented in ``descKeypoints``. All detectors are looped over in one main loop that executes all 
Detector / Descriptor combinations.

### MP.5 Descriptor Matching

Descriptor matching is set to BF-matching by default. FLANN-matching is implemented in ``matchDescriptors`` an can be activated by setting ``matcherType`` to
``"MAT_FLANN"``.

### MP.6 Descriptor Distance Ratio

k-Nearest-Neighbor matching is implemented in ``matchDescriptors`` and set by default (``selectorType = "SEL_KNN"``).

## Cource Content

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

The idea of the camera course is to build a collision detection system - that's the overall goal for the Final Project. As a preparation for this, you will now build the feature tracking part and test various detector / descriptor combinations to see which ones perform best. This mid-term project consists of four parts:

* First, you will focus on loading images, setting up data structures and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize memory load. 
* Then, you will integrate several keypoint detectors such as HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed. 
* In the next part, you will then focus on descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN approach we discussed in the previous lesson. 
* In the last part, once the code framework is complete, you will test the various algorithms in different combinations and compare them with regard to some performance measures. 

See the classroom instruction and code comments for more details on each of these parts. Once you are finished with this project, the keypoint matching part will be set up and you can proceed to the next lesson, where the focus is on integrating Lidar points and on object detection using deep-learning.
